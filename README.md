# WiFiScout

**Note:** currently only works with a tracefile, live capture will be implemented *soon*â„¢.

## Setup

You need to have `tshark` installed. It generally comes with Wireshark.

### SQLite database

If you want to use the Fingerbank SQLite database, you will need to download it
and set the `$FINGERBANK_SQLITE_PATH` env variable accordingly.

e.g: `export FINGERBANK_SQLITE_PATH="packaged.sqlite3"`

### API

If you want to use the Fingerbank API, you will need to register for an API key
and set the `$FINGERBANK_API_KEY` env variable accordingly.

e.g: `export FINGERBANK_API_KEY="ABCDEF123456789"`

### Python dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

A `Pipfile` is included if you are familiar with [`pipenv`](https://github.com/kennethreitz/pipenv).
